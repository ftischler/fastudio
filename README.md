# Fastudio

This project was developed with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.1.2.

## Description
Fastudio is a web based platform for all fashion designers across Africa to help setup a live global portfolio
to showcase their amazing designs to the world and connecting them with their potential clients.
Fastudio also makes life very easy for clients in the sense that you don't have to walk around the whole community before
you can get a competent designer to get your job done. With fastudio, you sew on the go.
